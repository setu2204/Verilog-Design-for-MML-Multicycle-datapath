# Verilog-Design-for-MML-Multicycle-datapath
Coding and Implementation of a multicycle datapath for Modified MIPS Lite (MML) instruction set architecture (ISA) using Verilog. Design the FSMs (bubble diagrams) and Data Path (block diagram) according to the requirnment,code and stimulate FSM in Verilog.Interlink the FSM to the datapath in top-level Verilog and attain the run-time (static)output.
